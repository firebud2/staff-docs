# staff hierarchies

A hierarchy (from the Greek hierarchia, "rule of a high priest", from
hierarkhes, "leader of sacred rites") is an arrangement of items
(objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are
represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one
another. *-[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy)*

## About
This document outlines the hierarchies within our staff structure.

### Hierarchies
---------------
#### Collaborative Teams:
These are flexible teams where the work allows a team member to not
be managed by one another.

Often times a manager will be involved in each role or for multiple
roles but generally if it's multiple they all work together very
closely already.

This allows a team member to to work collaboratively with the same
or another role within their team without being directly managed by
a different role when there are per-role managers present.

All hierarchies aside from internal work-flows should go as follows:

#### Management
The management team generally works collaboratively to accomplish goals
although the hierarchy goes as follows:
