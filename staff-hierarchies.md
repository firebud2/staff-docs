# staff hierarchies

A hierarchy (from the Greek hierarchia, "rule of a high priest", from
hierarkhes, "leader of sacred rites") is an arrangement of items
(objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are
represented as being "above", "below", or "at the same level as" one
another. *-[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy)*

## About
This document outlines the hierarchies within our staff structure.

### Hierarchies
---------------
#### Types

Collaborative Teams:

    These are flexible teams where the work allows a team member to not
    be managed by one another.

    Often times a manager will be involved in each role or for multiple
    roles but generally if it's multiple they all work together very
    closely already.

    This allows a team member to to work collaboratively with the same
    or another role within their team without being directly managed by
    a different role when there are per-role managers present.

All hierarchies aside from internal work-flows should go as follows:

#### Management
The management team generally works collaboratively to accomplish goals
although the hierarchy goes as follows:

1. **Project Lead**, management hierarch.
    1. **Creative Director**, subordinate of the *Project Lead*.
        1. **Manager**, subordinate of the *Creative Director*.
            1. **Supervisor**, subordinate of a *Manager*.

#### Administration
The administrative team is a collaborative hierarchy with management
embedded for each major administrative role to lead.

#### Moderation
The moderation team is a collaborative hierarchy with management
embedded for each major moderation role to lead.

1. **Moderation Team Manager**, moderation team hierarch.
    1. **Forum Moderation Manager**, forums moderation team hierarch.
    Subordinate of *Moderation Team Manager*.
        1. **Forum Moderator**, subordinate of *Forum Moderation Manager*.
